# kcm_razerdrivers

KConfig Module for [razer-drivers by @terrycain](https://github.com/terrycain/razer-drivers). This project is supposed to be used for configuring Razer devices in the KDE system settings.

## Current status
* librazer shared library (will be split from this repo when it is halfway usable)
* Displays your devices
* Has a nice (the official) icon
* Can set the brightness of all devices
* Can set some (you could say "most") effects
* Display correct "thumbnails" for devices (coming)
* Converted to normal Qt app instead of a KCM

**Otherwise ~~completely~~ *mostly* unusable**

## TODO

* Actually set the colors
* Implement keyboard gui (individual lighting etc)
* **Much** more
